"A Soup with Friends" is a very random project, that had no other finalities
other than allowing me, at two months from the start of my coding journey, 
to experiment with my HTML, CSS and basic JS skills.

I have to say I enjoyed doing it. 
I understand that a soup is not the most tempting meal I could have prepared for such a great event,
but hey, my friends arrived after all and we all had a good fun.
